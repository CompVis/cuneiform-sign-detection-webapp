## ./data folder

All the data about groups and collections are stored here. One group can consist of multiple collections.
- `dataconfig.json` contains all the meta data about the groups and collections.
- group-level data is store in the subdirectories of the data folder (e.g. data/cuneiform).
- collection-level data is stored in subdirectories of the group folders (e.g. data/cuneiform/test/).
- each group comes with a specific dictionary (e.g. data/cuneiform/dictionary.json) and a performance folder that contains the detections generated by the sign detector.
- each collection folder contains folders for storing the images, thumbnails, line and sign annotations as well as a imagesList.xml that provides all the meta data concerning the images in the collection.
